== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= CSS Styling =

CSS styling can be done very easy by applying basic CSS override rules by adding a activetrail-custom.css into your theme folder and it will be automatically included after the main plugin css.
In that .css file you can write css rules, for example the color of the submit button border to red, by simply writing this line: 

    body .atrail .btn { border:1px solid red; }
